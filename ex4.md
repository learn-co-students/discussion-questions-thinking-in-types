## Operators as 'Functions'

You can think of many operators as if they were functions. They take in inputs
and evaluate to an output.

### For the following operators, fill in the types of the inputs and outputs. Following the example, try to write out a function signature, as if the operator was a function. 
For more examples of function signatures, see the previous exercise.


| Operator   | types of inputs  | type of output | function signature                         |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| \*         | _number, number_ | _number_       | _multiply(a: number, b: number): number_   |
| + (string) | string, string   | string         | concatenate(a: string, b: string): string  |
| + (number) | number, number   | number         | add(a: number, b: number): number          |
| -          | number, number   | number         | subtract(a: number, b: number): number     |
| \*\*       | number, number   | number         | exponentiate(a: number, b: number): number |
| \|\|       | boolean, boolean | boolean        | logicalOR(a: bool, b: bool): boolean       |
| &&         | boolean, boolean | boolean        | logicalAND(a: bool, b: bool): boolean      |
| ^ (bonus)  | number, number   | number         | bitwiseXOR(a: number, b: number): number   |
